#+LAYOUT: default

Hello, my name is Cherry!

I do independent development as part of a small doujin. This page is
quickly thrown together because I found that the default page I had
for my Nginx server for a bit to be boring.

This should just give you a small glimpse of myself.

I just use my Twitter account for content consumption nothing really
valuable there. I hardly even use it anymore.
